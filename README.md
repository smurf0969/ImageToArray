# ImageToArray
Image file to coded array for use within code for OLED displays.
For best results edit your image first in your favorite image editing program and convert the image to Black & White.  
This tool was primarily designed to work with 128px x 64px images, but others should work as long as the dimensions are divisible by 8.  

Different libraries use different formats, so this tool provides two formats for the libraries I've used.  
If your image doesn't look right, just try again using the other format.

I have included the 128x64 image I use for my [WiFiConnect](https://github.com/smurf0969/WiFiConnect) project for you to try it out with.

Enjoy!!
